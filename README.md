# Hi there I'm Chris :wave:

**About me :telescope:**

I'm a 39yo software engineer based in Melbourne :australia:

I have been in the B2B Sales space for 15+ years, which has made me very attentive, understanding to customer needs and adapting in a fast moving environment.

I have always been curious about the tech industry and I recently started my journey in web development with Le Wagon Melbourne: a 24-week part-time coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, SQL and Ruby on Rails. Towards the end of the bootcamp I developed with my team a Rails Social-Styled application (www.love-lumina.me) which allows users to connect with like minded individuals in their community through leveraging the Meetup-PRO API.

When I am not coding, I love cycling :bicyclist:, traveling :earth_africa: and good coffee :coffee:.

I am currently working in the B2B Sales sector. I am also open to discuss opportunities as a Junior Software Developer, within a team that builds great tech products and with a strong positive social impact.

**How to reach me :mailbox:**

I will be very happy to catch up with you around a beer :beer: or a coffee :coffee:
