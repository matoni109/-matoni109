# Hi there I'm Chris :wave:

**About me :telescope:**

I'm a 39yo based in Melbourne, originally from Perth :australia:

When I am not coding, I love cycling :bicyclist:, traveling :earth_africa: and good coffee :coffee:.

I'm most interested in working in a team environment, striving together to solve problems and learn along the way.

**How to reach me :mailbox:**

I will be very happy to catch up with you around a beer :beer: or a coffee :coffee:
